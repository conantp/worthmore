Even neighborhoods thoroughly gentrified but formerly largely Black are more likely to be paying more than their fair share of property taxes, such is the legacy public policy of decades past. The inverse is also true. High-income, large property holders, and traditionally white neighrbohoods pay less than their fair share. How do we know this?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The work of Asheville-based tax and equity consultancy firm </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.urbanthree.com/">Urban3</a></span><span>&nbsp;dedicated more than 300 hours of their staff time to prove this on a county wide scale. Their data claims that property owners below the median value are subsidizing those above the median value by up to $5.5 million per year county-wide.

The Worthmore Project is inspired by that work, and allows you to peek inside the immense pile of public data to compare any single property in Buncombe County with one of the most famous and most visited pieces of land in the world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Whether racist and inequitable outcomes are intentionally written into the law (</span><span class="c8">de jure</span><span>) or implemented in organized (or ad hoc) fashion by institutions downstream of the legislative process (</span><span class="c8">de facto</span><span class="c4">), the effect is the same to those experiencing it. The law and its implementation even when “correctly” applied by a seemingly unbiased assessor generates inequitable outcomes. These outcomes favor the largest and wealthiest landowners and punishes the smallest and most impoverished. It could be argued that this was the intention all along. After all, small landowners have little influence over tax policy, and people who pay property taxes indirectly via rental payments as tenants have even less.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>If you think that your property is unfairly assessed, you can </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/governing/depts/tax/appeals.aspx">ask for an appeal for reappraisal</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;during certain windows of time after the appraisal by the county.

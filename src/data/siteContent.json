He is also currently a Independent candidate for Asheville City Council. He is currently enrolled at University of North Carolina at Asheville, where he took Land Economics in the Spring semester of 2022 with Professor Leah Mathews. Project #Worthmore is his Course Project for that class, where the assignment was to create an artifact that would continue to have use after the term ended. The purpose of the tool was to trigger thinking about the nature of tax assessments, and to get people to think about the nature of fairness and equity in how we fund municipal government. He lives in Asheville, NC with eight chickens: Anna, Sunny B, Shrimpinauty, Aegon Targaryhen, Gadget, Ruth Bader Ginsbird, Eggatha Christie and Harrie (pictured, left).",

In addition to our love of building slick websites and apps, we also deeply love our community! Our tight-knit team of four is dedicated to building things to support the efforts of non-profits, advocacy groups, and government agencies who do good around town. When Andrew reached out to us about his idea for Project #Worthmore we were all in and immediately started building a tool that could pull property values from Buncombe County Public Data. The site design came together simultaneously and the rest is history! We're really proud of this site and the work Andrew is doing and hope this starts more conversations about property taxes in our area and beyond.",
